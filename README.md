I began my career as a Solution Engineer, providing technical support for solutions across a variety of industries. I have experience in building and managing AWS infrastructure, with strengths in system administration and automation. Additionally, I excel in the operation and improvement of application- or solution-based systems. 

Currently, I work in cloud management at a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of South Korea, handling operations related to national railway sales and associated administrative tasks. 

I have a strong interest in Kubernetes technology and have earned all relevant certifications, including Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS), Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA), and Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security Associate (KCSA). This achievement has granted me the CNCF Kubestronaut title.
